## What This Project Does

![Huginn](https://raw.github.com/huginn/huginn/master/media/huginn-logo.png "Your agents are standing by.")

-----

## What is Huginn?

Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online.  They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.

![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)

#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:

* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow ("Don't forget your umbrella!")
* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term "machine learning" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)
* Watch for air travel or shopping deals
* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them
* Scrape websites and receive email when they change
* Connect to HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.
* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day
* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term "san francisco emergency"
* Send and receive WebHooks
* Run custom JavaScript functions
* Track your location over time
* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows with the external [HumanTaskAgent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_human_task_agent). For example: "Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog."

Have an awesome idea but not feeling quite up to contributing yet? Head over to our [Official 'suggest an agent' thread ](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues/353) and tell us!

## Examples

Please checkout the [Huginn Introductory Screencast](http://vimeo.com/61976251)!

And now, some example screenshots.  Below them are instructions to get you started.

## Getting Started

### Docker

The quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/docker/install.md).

### Local Installation

If you just want to play around, you can simply fork this project, then perform the following steps:

* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main project as a remote for your fork.
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.
* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.
* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password printed by `rake db:seed` (or set `SEED_PASSWORD` to choose one).
* Setup some Agents!
* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.
* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.

Note: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view
them at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing
with Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.

If you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`f126765f544a834ef2b8493fbfeba880e6d1284b3d566861ae5b3c88b43111b9`.

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
